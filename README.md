Hi, I'm Elliott

I am currently studying Mechanical Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin with a focus on mechatronics and robotics. I mostly work in python and have recently been getting into writing code for embedded systems in C. I also have limited experience with full stack development and do my homework in MATLAB.
